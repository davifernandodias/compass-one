This is a simple landing page project, using good responsiveness practices such as "flexbox" and "grid". The construction of the landing page was done using the mobile first concept. The stack used was just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The approach adopted was the componentization of elements through a vanilla technique, where functions return strings of HTML elements and are injected into the DOM using `innerHTML`. This allows for a more fluid and modular construction of the page, without the need for external frameworks or libraries. For more details, see the official documentation: [MDN Web Docs - innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML).
